The Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Input the number of rows (let's call it n).
3. Initialize an outer loop with a counter i from 1 to n. This represents the current row and the number to be printed.
4. Initialize an inner loop with a counter j from 1 to i.
5. Inside the inner loop, print the value of i.
6. After the inner loop ends, print a newline character (\n) to move to the next row.
7. Repeat until the outer loop finishes.
8. End.
