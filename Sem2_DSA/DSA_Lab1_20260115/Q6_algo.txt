The Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
2. Prompt the user to enter an integer.
3. Read the input into a variable num.
4. While num is not equal to 0:
       If num is greater than 0:
           Add num to sum.
       Prompt the user for the next integer.
       Read the next input into num.
5. Print the final sum.
6. End.
